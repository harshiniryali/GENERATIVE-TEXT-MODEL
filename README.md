# GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL

##This Generative Text Model is designed to generate coherent and meaningful text based on given prompt. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning frameworks, the model can create human-like responses, complete sentences, or generate creative content such as stories, summaries, and dialogue.
Built upon pre-trained transformer architectures like GPT-2, GPT-3, this modelleverages vast linguistic knowledge to produce contextualized and syntactically accurate text. It can be fine-tuned for specialized applications, making it adaptable for various domains, including chatbots, content creation, and automated report generation.

##Features

**Context-aware text generation** :Produces meaningful, structured output based on input prompts.

**Fine-tuning capabilities** :Users can train the model on custom datasets for domain-specific applications.

**Adjustable creativity and coherence** :Control randomness using temperature and top-k sampling.

**Integration with API's** :Supports REST API access for seamless integration into applications.

**Efficient training and inference** :Optimized implementation for fast performance.

##Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshiniryali/GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL.git
cd GENERATIVE-TEXT-MODEL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Usage

Run the model to generate text from a prompt:
python generate.py --prompt "Once upon a time..."

##How it works?

**Preprocessing** :Tokenizes and cleans input text.

**Transformer Model** :Uses a pre-trained language model for text generation.

**Sampling and output** :Applies beam search, top-k/top-p sampling to refine responses.

**Post-processing** :Formats the output to enhance readability.
